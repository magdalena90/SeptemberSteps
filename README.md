# SeptemberSteps

Small Shiny dashboard to visualise the steps from Space Intelligence's September Steps challenge. Data is inputted from the [SI September Steps](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qq5_I3ciLrmO6AHv_z-64wlzzw64zNlDnE8Rxpl-Ur0/edit?usp=sharing) Google spreadsheet and the script just aggreates the data and creates visualisations of the trends.

The code was taken from [another dashboard](https://github.com/magdalena90/GeneradorDeMenus) I made for my mum to generate lunchtime menus.
